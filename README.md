# Webmap
Code to create an interactive web map containing world population information layered on top of volcano locations throughout the USA.

The map has layer control, so it is optional to display volcano information, population information or both (or neither). 

The population information is displayed as a chloropleth map for the entire globe, showing green for countries with populations of less than 10m, yellow for populations between 10m and 30m and red for populations larger than 30m.

The volcano information covers North America. Clicking on a marker will produce a popup to appear containing elevation data and a hyperlink to Google search results for that volcano. The colour markers are dynamic and indicate different height ranges depending on the colour of the marker, ie green represents heights lower than 1000m, orange represents heights between 1000m and 3000m and red represents heights above 3000m.
